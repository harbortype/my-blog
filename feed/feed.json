			"title": "Kerning in PowerPoint",
			"content_html": "<p>Microsoft Word expects kerning data in a GPOS table. PowerPoint expects it in an old style kern table. This is how I make it work in both apps.</p>\n<p>In Glyphs, I first prepare my font using the <em>Kern Flattener</em> script by <a href=\"https://github.com/mekkablue/Glyphs-Scripts\">mekkablue</a>. It will open a copy of the current document, turn all group kerning into glyph kerning and set some other parameters. I export this new document somewhere as TTF and close the file. There’s no need to save it as it will not be needed anymore.</p>\n<p>I then extract the <code>kern</code> table of the exported fonts as XML using <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools\">ttx</a></strong>. The following Terminal command will do that for a couple of font files:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-plain\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-plain\">ttx -t kern -o SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml SomeFont-Regular.ttf\nttx -t kern -o SomeFont-Bold-kern.xml SomeFont-Bold.ttf</code></pre>\n<p>I don’t like having a bunch of duplicate TTFs laying around to trip me up, so I immediately delete the fonts.</p>\n<p>Back to the original glyphs file, I export the TTFs as usual. Then, it is time to merge the <code>kern</code> table extracted above with the final fonts. This is the Terminal command:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-plain\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-plain\">ttx -m SomeFont-Regular.ttf SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml\nttx -m SomeFont-Bold.ttf SomeFont-Bold-kern.xml</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, it is possible to merge a table into a font via Python script by creating an empty TTFont object, importing the XML into it and then copying the table over. Something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-plain\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-plain\">from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont\n\nttf_file = \"SomeFont-Regular.ttf\"\nkern_file = \"SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml\"\n\nttf_font = TTFont(ttf_file)\nkern_font = TTFont()\nkern_font.importXML(kern_file)\nttf_font[\"kern\"] = kern_font[\"kern\"]\nttf_font.save(ttf_file)</code></pre>\n<figure class=\"screenshot\" style=\"max-width: min(960px, var(--content-width)););\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-960.webp 960w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-1920.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-960.jpeg 960w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-1920.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/png\" srcset=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-960.png 960w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-1920.png 1920w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/AkKQ9PF8UG-960.jpeg\" width=\"960\" height=\"700\" alt=\"Screenshot of a PowerPoint for Mac window.

Surprisingly, the kerning of those glyphs works in Word and does not affect the kerning in PowerPoint. This was tested to be working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>version 2309 of Word and PowerPoint 365</li>\n<li>version 16.78 of Word and PowerPoint for Mac</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Inspired by Melanie Richards’ <a href=\"https://melanie-richards.com/blog/tags/learning-log\">Learning Logs</a>, I’m starting this series to document things that happened to me each month. The reason I’m not calling it “learning logs” is that I feel I’m not very productive in the self-improvement area most of the time, so calling it a “month in review” seems lighter on me. I’ll try my best to remember what I did each month and to keep this going. No promises, though.</p>\n<p>October started with me and my wife making the down payment for our new apartment. We are still waiting on the bank to finish their part of the paperwork, but if it all goes well we should have a new home around the end of November.</p>\n<figure class=\"width-480 float-right\" style=\"max-width: min(480px, var(--content-width)););\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-480.webp 480w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-960.webp 960w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-2048.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><source type=\"image/jpeg\" srcset=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-480.jpeg 480w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-960.jpeg 960w, https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/img/y3A1vU0oM0-480.jpeg\" width=\"480\" height=\"319\" alt=\"Five people stading on a wooden deck with foliage in the background\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"></picture><figcaption>The Fabio Haag Type team, from left to right: Eduilson Coan, Sofia Mohr, Ana Laydner, me and Fabio Haag.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Around the middle of the month there was a <a href=\"https://fabiohaagtype.com/en\">Fabio Haag Type</a> team meetup. It was not as formal as I make it sound. We are a remote team, so it is nice to see one another face to face once in a while. We had lunches, beers and worked a little bit as well. It was very fun :)</p>\n<p>On smaller news, it’s been a while that my PS4 wouldn’t boot and I finally took it to a repair shop for an evaluation. As I only used it to play Rocket League (which has become kinda toxic) or when we had guests, I didn’t have interested in getting it fixed. Instead, I proposed an exchange of the bricked PS4 for a pair of Joy‑Cons and they accepted. A small win!</p>\n<p>And towards the end of the month I restarted this blog and that’s something worth celebrating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reading <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/blog/month-in-review-2023-10/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I’ve been trying to ditch YouTube before bedtime and read a book instead. The problem is, depending on the book I’m reading, I get sleepy very quickly and it takes me ages to finish anything. As I have lunch by myself during the week, I figured I should take my Kindle with me and use that time to read as well. It has been very effective.</p>\n<p>This month I finished reading the Truman Capote’s classic <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23728/in-cold-blood-by-truman-capote/\">In Cold Blood</a>. Capote’s retelling of the Holcomb murders is so detailed that I am sure at least half of the things he narrates did not really happen. But it was a nice read, regardless.</p>\n<p>I also read the more recent memoir <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/How-to-Murder-Your-Life/Cat-Marnell/9781476752419\">How to Murder Your Life</a> by Cat Marnell. The autobiography of a high-functioning drug addict working on the fashion publishing industry, this one was a rollercoaster. The author herself recognizes there’s something about the downfall of rich privileged people that makes it hard for us to look away.

My favorite episode so far is <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18233708\">episode 7, “Review”</a>. It was nice to watch a show that does not immediatly makes the main characters fall in love for each other. Let’s hope it keeps it like that in the second season.</p>\n<h2 id=\"listening\" tabindex=\"-1\">Listening <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://henriquebeier.com/eleventy-base-blog/blog/month-in-review-2023-10/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The most recent songs I’ve added to my Deezer favorite tracks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlwp9GT2KFQ\">Popstar researching oblivion</a> by Flotation Toy Warning</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGK86V8puAM\">Happiness</a> by Hobo Johnson</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTEZm5AYslw\">Hayloft II</a> by Mother Mother</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRWUoDpo2fo\">Left Hand Free</a> by alt-J</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3K1UlEaVGw\">Bitch</a> by Allie X</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCMMZHlSQCQ\">Elephant Woman</a> by Blonde Redhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_vR5u5QxZY\">DNA</a> by Anna F.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I grew tired of many of the podcasts I usually listen to, so I am giving them a break. On the other hand, I’m binge listening to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/IfBooksPod\">If Books Could Kill</a> and I’m loving it. They have a similar vibe to <a href=\"https://underunderstood.com/podcast/new-start-here\">Underunderstood</a>, which I like. And I’m also enjoying the latest episodes of <a href=\"https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/welcome-to-search-engine\">Search Engine</a> (the theme song is incredibly catchy).</p>\n<p>Writing it all out, it looks like October was more eventful than my usual month. Let’s see what November will bring!</p>\n",
