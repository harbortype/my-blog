		<h1>Month in review: October 2023</h1>

		<ul class="post-metadata">

		<p>Inspired by Melanie Richards’ <a href="https://melanie-richards.com/blog/tags/learning-log">Learning Logs</a>, I’m starting this series to document things that happened to me each month. The reason I’m not calling it “learning logs” is that I feel I’m not very productive in the self-improvement area most of the time. I’ll try my best to remember what I did each month and to keep this going. No promises, though.</p>

		<p>October started with me and my wife making the down payment for our new apartment. We are still waiting on the bank to finish their part of the paperwork, but if it all goes well we should have a new home around the end of November.</p>
		<p>Around the middle of the month there was a Fabio Haag Type team meetup. It was not as formal as I make it sound. We are a remote team, so it is nice to see one another face to face once in a while. We had lunches, beers and worked a little bit as well. It was very fun :)</p>

		<p>It’s been a while that my PS4 Pro wouldn’t boot, no matter what. I finally took it to a repair shop for an evaluation. As I only used it to play Rocket League (which has been a toxic experience) or when we had guests, I didn’t have interested in getting it fixed, so I proposed an exchange of the bricked PS4 for a pair of Joy-Cons. They accepted.</p>
		<p>Towards the end of the month I restarted this blog and that’s something worth celebrating.</p>

		<p>I’ve been trying to ditch YouTube before bedtime and read a book instead. But the thing is, depending on the book I’m reading, I get sleepy very fast and it takes me ages to finish anything. As I have lunch by myself during the week, I figured I should take my Kindle with me and use that time to read as well. It has been very effective.</p>
		<p>This month I finished reading the Truman Capote’s classic <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23728/in-cold-blood-by-truman-capote/">In Cold Blood</a>. Capote’s retelling of the Holcomb murders is so detailed that I am sure at least half of the things he narrates did not really happen. But it was a nice read, regardless.</p>
		<p>I also read the more recent memoir <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/How-to-Murder-Your-Life/Cat-Marnell/9781476752419">How to Murder Your Life</a> by Cat Marnell. This one was a rollercoaster.</p>

		<p>We’ve watched the first season of The One in Charge (El Encargado).</p>
		<p>I also finished the first season of The Bear. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18233708/?ref_=ttep_ep7">Episode 7, “Review”</a>, is my favorite one so far. It was nice to watch a show that does not immediatly makes the main characters fall in love for each other. Let’s hope it keeps it like that in the second season.</p>
		<p>We have finally caught up with Taskmaster. This is the show we usually watch on Saturday nights.</p>

		<p>I grew tired of many of the podcasts I usually listen to, so I am giving them a break. On the other hand, I’m binge listening to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/IfBooksPod">If Books Could Kill</a> and I’m loving it. They have a similar vibe to [Underunderstood](https://underunderstood.com/podcast/new-start-here/, which I like. And I’m also enjoying the latest episodes of <a href="https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/welcome-to-search-engine">Search Engine</a> (the theme song is incredibly catchy).</p>
