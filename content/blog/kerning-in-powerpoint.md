Microsoft Word expects kerning data in the GPOS table. PowerPoint expects it in the old style kern table. This is how I make it work in both apps.

I use Glyphs, so I first prepare my font using the **Kern Flattener** script by mekkablue. It will open an unsaved copy of the glyphs file, which youâ€™ll export somewhere as TTF. No need to save the glyphs file as it will not be needed anymore.

After that, extract the `kern` table of those fonts as XML using `ttx`. The following command will do that for a single font file:

```bash
ttx -t kern -o SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml SomeFont-Regular.ttf
```

Back to the original .glyphs file, export the TTFs as usual. Then, it is time to merge the `kern` table extracted above with the final font. You can do this with this Terminal command:

```bash
ttx -m SomeFont-Regular.ttf SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml
```

Alternatively, it is possible to merge a table into a font via Python script by creating an empty TTFont object, importing the XML into it and then copying the table over:

```py
from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont

ttf_file = "SomeFont-Regular.ttf"
kern_file = "SomeFont-Regular-kern.xml"

ttf_font = TTFont(ttf_file)
kern_font = TTFont()
kern_font.importXML(kern_file)
ttf_font["kern"] = kern_font["kern"]
ttf_font.save(ttf_file)
```

As PowerPoint does not support OpenType features, it can only access glyphs that have Unicode values. I have tested this with a font that has stylistic sets (unencoded glyphs) which have kerning values. The kerning of those glyphs will work elsewhere.

This was tested to be working on:

- Word and PowerPoint 365 version 2309
- Word and PowerPoint for Mac version 16.78
