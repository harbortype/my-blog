The [enshittification of the web](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) forces me to revive my blog. 

I’ve been getting more and more uncomfortable giving my data to big corporations and not owning it. Not that I post much, because I don’t. But it bothers me still.

I like the idea of personal blogs and I figured this is something I should try again. I’ve been following some nice personal blogs and microblogs like [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net), [Aegir](http://aegir.org/), [Adrianna Tan](https://micro.popagandhi.com), [Melanie Richards](https://melanie-richards.com), and others. It was [Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/notes)’s new project [Own Your Web](https://buttondown.email/ownyourweb) that pushed me towards restarting this site.

I’m not really sure how this is going to work, but let’s see where this takes me.
