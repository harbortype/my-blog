What an amazing piece of software [Bebop](https://www.jackcheng.com/bebop/) is. It opens up instantly with the keyboard ready to go. You type your thoughts into it and tap Save Note. It saves it to a folder you have configured and starts a new blank note. Just&nbsp;perfect!

I came across it yesterday on the [Installer](https://www.theverge.com/24158659/ai-assistant-chatgpt-gpt4o-google-search-dyson-washg1-installer) newsletter and Iâ€™m looking forward to integrating it into my workflow.

Also, lovely shade of yellow.
