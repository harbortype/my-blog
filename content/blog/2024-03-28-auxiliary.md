First exercise using [TypeCooker](http://typecooker.com/) to flex my creativity. This took me longer than I’d like to admit. I’m still not really happy with the way the strokes join in the crotch areas but hey, I need to let them go.

**TypeCooker parameters:**

- Construction: *Roman*
- Stroke Endings: *Straight, No Serif*
- Contrast Amount: *Visible*
- Contrast Type: *Translation*
- Width: *Narrow*
- Weight: *Light*
