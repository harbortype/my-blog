Today, some of my fonts were launched at [I Love Typography](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/fonts/harbor-type). I used to spend hours and hours reading ILT back when I was in college. It was (and probably still is) the most complete blog on the topic. I mean, just take a look at [the archive](https://ilovetypography.com/contents/). 

The last few years has seen the consolidation of loads of intellectual property in very few hands. You could almost say the font market is starting to look like a Mono... poly. 

From my perspective, ILT brings a breath of fresh air into this market by being a more humane alternative to other big font distributors. I love that they have a curation of the products they sell and promote, plus their proprietary [CEDARS+ search](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/cedars). Have you tried it? It is so powerful!

I’d like to thank [Nadine Chahine](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/about/meet-the-team) for welcoming me so well to ILT. I’m so happy to be part of it!
