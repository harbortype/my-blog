Inspired by Melanie Richards’ [Learning Logs](https://melanie-richards.com/blog/tags/learning-log), I’m starting this series to document things that happened to me each month. I’ll try my best to both remember what I did and to keep this going. No promises, though.

The month started with me and my wife making the down payment for our new apartment. We are still waiting on the bank to finish their paperwork, but if it all goes well we should have a new home around the end of November.

It’s been a month that my PS4 Pro wouldn’t boot, no matter what. I finally took it to a repair shop but I had no interest in fixing it. As I only used it to play Rocket League (which has been a toxic experience) or when we had guests, I proposed an exchange of the bricked PS4 for a pair of Joy-Cons. They accepted.

On the 18th and 19th there was the gathering of the Fabio Haag Type team. We work remotely, so it is nice to see one another face to face once in a while. We had lunches, beers and worked a little bit as well. It was very fun :)

Towards the end of the month I restarted this blog. That’s something.


## Reading

I’ve been trying to ditch YouTube before bedtime and read a book instead. However, depending on the book I’m reading I get sleepy very fast and it took me ages to finish anything. I recently decided to take my Kindle to lunch and use that time to read as well. As I have lunch by myself during the week, this has been very effective.

This month I finished reading the Truman Capote’s classic [In Cold Blood](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23728/in-cold-blood-by-truman-capote/). Capote’s retelling of the Holcomb murders is so detailed that I am sure at least half of the things he narrates did not really happen. But it was a nice read, regardless.

I also read the more recent memoir [How to Murder Your Life](https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/How-to-Murder-Your-Life/Cat-Marnell/9781476752419) by Cat Marnell.
