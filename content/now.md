<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>

I’m closing the purchase of our new apartment, so I’ve been anxious for this move. It will take a couple of months, though.

I am adding lighter weights for my [Dona typeface](https://www.harbortype.com/fonts/dona/). Also, I started working on a display serif typeface for a change (in [FontLab](https://www.fontlab.com) for no good reason). It’s way too early to share anything just yet, but it’s nice not to be working on yet another sans.

As a personal project, I am experimenting on tracking the books I am reading, want to or have read in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

This **Now** page was inspired by the movement started by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about). It&nbsp;was last updated on October 23rd, 2023.
