<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>

I’m trying to take a picture every day and upload it to [Retro](https://retro.app). I’m also considering logging the number of watermelons we eat each summer (we are at 5 in less than 40 days).

Font-wise, I decided to completely rework my [Dona typeface](https://www.harbortype.com/fonts/dona/) and launch it with another name.

We’ll be living in our new apartment for a year next month.

This **Now** page was inspired by the movement started by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about). It&nbsp;was last updated on January 3rd, 2025.
